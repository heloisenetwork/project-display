# Welcome to Abaelardus
**This app is an simple Webfrontend of the Heloise-Network.**

It was created to explore the indexed data of Heloise Projectpartner. It is meant as an first step to make the aggregated data visible to the user.

## Functions

Abaelardus just displays the data of a **running** *elasticsearch* instance. Elasticsearch must run on localhost:9200 at the moment.

## Installation

There are no steps necessary to make the app run, since it is a small HTML-Page with some simple js-functionalities. Just open it in a browser.

Remember that a running elasticsearch on localhost is needed.

Have a look at [the Heloise Project-Crawler](https://github.com/heloisenetwork/project-crawler) to get in touch with the index-structure of elasticsearch.
